# Scripting project proposal - Samantha Grady

## **Purpose**
To analyze of 16S DNA sequencing data to determine and compare the bacterial composition of multiple samples.

### **Languages**
Python and R

###  **Existing packages**
`fastqc`

`trimmomatic`

`plotPCA`

`QIIME` or `Parallel-META 3`

`GUniFrac`

`possibility - Bowtie 2`

### **Data**
Samples will be sent for sequencing within the next week and I expect the data roughly 2 weeks after they recieve the samples. I can use other metagenomic 16S data before I recieve my own data for testing my code in the meantime; There are several papers that have their 16S data available on NCBI.
