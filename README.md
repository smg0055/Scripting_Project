# Scripting project proposal - Samantha Grady

## **Purpose**
To analyze of 16S DNA sequencing data to determine and compare the bacterial composition of multiple samples.
### **Languages**
Python and R
### **Data**
Samples will be sent for sequencing within 2 weeks and I expect the data roughly 2 weeks after they recieve it. I can use other metagenomic 16S data before I recieve my own data for testing my code in the meantime.
